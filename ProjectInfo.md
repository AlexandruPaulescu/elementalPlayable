# elementalPlayable
This is the atmoshperic demo version of my indie dev studio's game, 'elemental'.

I started this project because I love creating games and coding them in the most unique way possible. I learnt a lot of things while developing this project, ranging from advanced video editing, all the way to social media marketing.
I learnt how to apply S.O.L.I.D correctly and concisely, as well as important OOP concepts, in Unity's main language, C#.

Thanks to this project, my programming has improved.

Also, the reason I haven't posted the actual game files is because the game is under active development and the demo should be shipped at the end of April!

These are some shots from the final version of the game, set to appear at the end of Summer 2022.
